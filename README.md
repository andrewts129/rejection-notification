# rejection-notification
Alerts me of getting rejected from internships by playing a sad song over the speakers of my Raspberry Pi

This script is set to run via cron every two minutes over my Raspberry Pi. When it runs, it checks my email and  
and looks at the most recent messages. If there's one that looks like an internship rejection email (I get a lot of those),  
it plays the song over the speakers.
